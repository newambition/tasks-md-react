## Usage

TaskMD Pro understands a special flavor of Markdown to build your boards.

### The Magic Words (Markdown Format)

- `# Space Name` become the titles of your Spaces.
- `## Phase Name` become the names of boards within spaces
- `- [ ] Your task here` is a new task.
- `- [x] Your completed task` is a finished task.
- Add a due date with `(DD-MM-YY)`.
- Add colorful labels with `[labelName]` or `[labelName(#hexcolor)]`.

**For example:**

```markdown
