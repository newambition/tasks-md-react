# Project Overview

This is a React application bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Key Files & Directories:

*   **Entry Point**: The application starts with `[public/index.html](mdc:public/index.html)`, which then loads the React application defined in `[src/index.js](mdc:src/index.js)`.
*   **Main Application Component**: The root React component is `[src/App.js](mdc:src/src/App.js)`.
*   **Styling**:
    *   Global styles and Tailwind CSS are configured in `[src/index.css](mdc:src/src/index.css)`.
    *   Tailwind configuration is in `[tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js)`.
    *   PostCSS configuration is in `[postcss.config.js](mdc:postcss.config.js)`.
*   **Public Assets**: Static assets are served from the `[public/](mdc:public)` directory.
*   **Components**: Reusable UI components are located in `[src/components/](mdc:src/src/components)`.
*   **State Management**: Application state is primarily managed using React Hooks and Context API, with core logic in `[src/hooks/useKanbanManager.js](mdc:src/src/hooks/useKanbanManager.js)` and related store files (`[src/store/](mdc:src/src/store)`).
*   **Routing**: (If applicable, this project does not appear to use a dedicated router like React Router in `App.js`, but manages views conditionally).
*   **Dependencies**: Project dependencies are listed in `[package.json](mdc:package.json)`.
*   **README**: For general project setup and scripts, refer to `[README.md](mdc:README.md)`.
